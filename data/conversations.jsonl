Share them with me when you get a chance!"}, {"role": "user", "content": "I'll send them over! But, actually, that's not all. I also captured something I didn't recognize. It's a faint, elongated object near a known globular cluster. I've checked all the catalogs, and... nothing.

What are the coordinates, and what does it look like in your image? Is it consistent across multiple exposures?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Exactly! It's consistent, showing up in all my stacked images. I've got the coordinates, and the object seems to be moving!
